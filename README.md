# Polar-Component Estimator
This repository contains the software framework for experiments conducted in a preprint of our paper, `Complementary Electro-Ionic Reconstruction Probed by Machine Learning-assisted Noise Spectroscopy`.

## Data Generator
`gen.py` calculates PSD curves and prints out them.

## Deep Learning Framework
This repo is based on the basic DL framework from LMLS lab at Inha University. The details will be updated soon.
