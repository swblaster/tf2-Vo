This repository contains the software framework for deep learning-based spectral microscopy analysis.

## Data Generator
Currently, `gen.py` calculates PSD curve and prints out it. Soon, the code will be parallelized using MPI.

## Deep Learning Framework
This repo is based on the basic DL framework from LMLS lab at Inha University. The details will be updated soon.
